Services are used for common Data
How components get data from Services:
Dependency Injection: it is design pattern which creates a new instance of parent values in the child so that if parent changes the values also child will not get affected.
how to do dependency injection in angular?
we will inject the service in the parameters of constructor

For the API, you need to use default service httpClient
First goto module and import httpClientModule and write it in imports
second goto service and inject httpClient

httpClient return Observable, it means mutiple promises, u will resolve it by subscribe
