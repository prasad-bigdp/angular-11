Data binding:
The transmission of Data from component to template or Template to Component or both
Angular supports one way and two way data binding
i. one way data binding:
   a. Component to Template:
     1. string interpolation: it is a way of getting data from component to template as a string
     we will do it by {{}}(double flower brackets)
     2.property Binding:
     it is also another way of sending data from component to template but it won't send data as string.
     we will do it using square brackets []
   b. from template to component
     this is called Event Binding. it is used to send data from template to component
     we will achieve this by paranthesis '()'

     Task1: in template print count value from component and on click of button in template, value of count should increase
     Task2: In your counter, on top right print a flag value which shows even/odd based on the value of counter
     Hint: i use ternary operator

     Two-way Data Binding:
      Two way data binding means data should be sent from component to template and template to component at a time

      we will achieve two way data binding by ngModel with like this "[(ngModel)]

      steps:
      syntax:<input [(ngModel)]="variable">, u will write variable in ts file(component file).
      To make ngModel work , import FormsModule in app.module.ts and write it in its imports

      Task3:
      create a simple form with email and password and a button and print email and password immediately when we type and also show alert "successsfully login" when click on button
